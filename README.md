# PacMen Exercise
This exercise demonstrates creating a PacMan "factory" for making pacmen with the help of the provided starter code. This project was refactored. I replaced the pacmen with 4 different images of frogs. I have also included an audio effect for when the sprites hit the window and bounce back. 

The frogs and the sound are a reference to [King Julio](https://www.tiktok.com/@meetjulio?), the famous australian green tree frog that became famous on Tik-Tok.


### How it works

When button "Add frog" is pressed, a static frog will appear on the screen at a random position. The "Add speed" increases the velocity of the frogs, while the "Reset" button refreshes the page and the user can begin playing the game again.

## How to run

Clone the respository and open the index.html file in your browser of choice. 

## Future improvements
* Fixing the sprites' initial / starting position so that they won't appear by any chance on any of the buttons. This blocks clicking the buttons and the user needs to refresh the entire page.

## Live demo
